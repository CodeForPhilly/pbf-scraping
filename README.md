Project for Philadelphia Bail Fund to scrape new criminal filings from municipal court


The [Philadelphia Bail Fund](https://www.phillybailfund.org/) uses new criminal filings posted to the [Municipal Court website](https://www.courts.phila.gov/NewCriminalFilings/date/default.aspx?search=2020-06-12) to identify individuals who may need assistance in posting bail. Currently, they scrape these filings daily and store them in csv's on a personal machine. 

This project is to create a tool that automates alerting of new filings and storage of all historical filings to a free hosting service, and potentially to make this data easily accessible to PBF for analysis.
